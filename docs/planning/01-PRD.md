## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: Claude API Rate Limits**
- Impact: High
- Probability: Medium
- Mitigation: Implement request queuing, show clear limits to users, add retry logic

**Risk 2: Large File Performance**
- Impact: Medium
- Probability: Medium
- Mitigation: Set file size limits, implement chunking for large files, show progress indicators

**Risk 3: Browser Compatibility**
- Impact: Low
- Probability: Low
- Mitigation: Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari; use polyfills where needed

### Timeline Risks

**Risk 4: Scope Creep**
- Impact: High
- Probability: High
- Mitigation: Strict adherence to P0 features only, defer P1/P2 to future phases

**Risk 5: Deployment Issues**
- Impact: Medium
- Probability: Low
- Mitigation: Use Vercel for simplified deployment, test early and often
