---

### Risk Management

**Risk: Timeline Overrun**
- Mitigation: Focus on Phase 1-2 fixes first (Issues #1-7)
- These are the critical blocking issues
- Phase 3-4 can be deferred if necessary

**Risk: Complex Keyboard Navigation**
- Mitigation: Use Radix UI or Headless UI library instead of custom implementation
- These are fully accessible out of the box

**Risk: Screen Reader Testing Unavailable**
- Mitigation: Use browser extensions like NVDA for Windows
- VoiceOver is built into macOS
- Both are free

**Risk: New Issues Found During Testing**
- Mitigation: Budget 3-5 extra hours on Day 10
- Prioritize critical issues only
- Document minor issues for future work

## ðŸš¨ Risk Management

### Critical Risks & Mitigations

**Risk: Claude API Rate Limits Hit**
- [ ] Monitor API usage daily
- [ ] Implement request queuing
- [ ] Show clear error to users
- [ ] Add retry with exponential backoff

**Risk: Scope Creep**
- [ ] Stick to P0 features only
- [ ] Defer all P1/P2 to future
- [ ] Time-box all tasks
- [ ] Use "good enough" mindset

**Risk: Deployment Failures**
- [ ] Test build locally first
- [ ] Have backup hosting plan (Netlify)
- [ ] Keep rollback option ready
- [ ] Deploy early (Day 4) if possible

**Risk: Time Overruns**
- [ ] Cut features, not quality
- [ ] Skip nice-to-haves
- [ ] Prioritize demo over perfection
- [ ] Can enhance post-launch
