### Risk Management

**Risk: Timeline Overrun**
- Mitigation: Focus on Phase 1-2 fixes first (Issues #1-7)
- These are the critical blocking issues
- Phase 3-4 can be deferred if necessary

**Risk: Complex Keyboard Navigation**
- Mitigation: Use Radix UI or Headless UI library instead of custom implementation
- These are fully accessible out of the box

**Risk: Screen Reader Testing Unavailable**
- Mitigation: Use browser extensions like NVDA for Windows
- VoiceOver is built into macOS
- Both are free

**Risk: New Issues Found During Testing**
- Mitigation: Budget 3-5 extra hours on Day 10
- Prioritize critical issues only
- Document minor issues for future work
