### Recent Accomplishments

#### **October 15, 2025 - Night Session (Part 5): UX Polish & Example Library Expansion** ⭐ NEW

**Focus:** User experience improvements, design system documentation, and example library expansion

##### 1. ExamplesModal Enhancement - Smart Selection
- ✅ **Auto-select current example when modal opens**:
  - Modal now detects which example is currently loaded in editor
  - Automatically pre-selects and highlights matching example
  - Focuses on the selected card for keyboard navigation
  - Falls back to first example if no match found
- **Implementation:**
  - Added `currentCode` prop to ExamplesModal
  - Example matching via code comparison (`code.trim()`)
  - Dynamic ref management for all example cards
  - Fixed `React.forwardRef` closing syntax error
- **Files Modified:**
  - `client/src/components/ExamplesModal.jsx` - Smart selection logic
  - `client/src/App.jsx` - Pass current code to modal

##### 2. Design System Refinement - Color Usage Patterns
- ✅ **Refined helper text and badge colors**:
  - **Helper Text:** Changed from indigo to slate (`bg-slate-100`, `text-slate-700`)
  - **Primary Badges (docType):** Kept indigo (`bg-indigo-100`, `text-indigo-700`)
  - **Secondary Badges (language):** Kept slate (`bg-slate-100`, `text-slate-600`)
  - Rationale: Slate for helper text reduces visual competition, indigo for primary info adds hierarchy
- ✅ **Documented UI Pattern Guidelines** in Figma Guide:
  - When to use slate vs indigo for different UI elements
  - Color hierarchy: Purple (actions) > Indigo (primary info) > Slate (secondary/chrome)
  - Decision rationale documented for future reference
- **Files Modified:**
  - `client/src/components/ExamplesModal.jsx` - Updated helper text colors
  - `docs/planning/07-Figma-Guide.md` - Added UI Pattern Guidelines section
  - `CLAUDE.md` - Updated to v1.7 with pattern guidelines

##### 3. Examples Library Expansion
- ✅ **Added 2 new code examples**:
  1. **Python Flask API** (id: `python-flask-api`):
     - Language: Python (first non-JavaScript example!)
     - Doc Type: API
     - Features: SQLAlchemy models, RESTful endpoints, authentication, CRUD operations
     - ~170 lines of production-quality Flask code
  2. **Microservices Architecture** (id: `microservices-architecture`):
     - Language: JavaScript
     - Doc Type: ARCHITECTURE
     - Features: API Gateway, 5 microservices, service discovery, saga pattern
     - ~240 lines demonstrating enterprise architecture patterns
- **Examples Library Summary:**
  - **Total:** 7 examples (up from 5)
  - **Languages:** JavaScript (6), Python (1)
  - **Doc Types:** README (2), JSDOC (2), API (2), ARCHITECTURE (1)
  - **Coverage:** All 4 doc types now represented
- **Files Modified:**
  - `client/src/data/examples.js` - Added 2 new examples

##### 4. Accessibility Improvements
- ✅ **Removed unnecessary tab stop in Quality Breakdown modal**:
  - Issue: Scrollable container was receiving focus between header and content
  - Fix: Added `tabIndex={-1}` to scrollable div
  - Result: Cleaner keyboard navigation (Close button → Copy button)
- **Files Modified:**
  - `client/src/components/QualityScore.jsx` - Tab order fix

##### 5. Visual Polish - Generating Animation
- ✅ **Fixed "box within a box" issue in generating state**:
  - Issue: `DocPanelGeneratingSkeleton` had redundant container with borders/header
  - Fix: Removed outer wrapper, component now renders only content inside DocPanel
  - Result: Cleaner, professional generating animation without nested boxes
- **Files Modified:**
  - `client/src/components/SkeletonLoader.jsx` - Simplified skeleton structure

**Impact Summary:**
- Enhanced user experience with smart modal behavior
- Established clear design patterns for consistent future development
- Expanded example library with multi-language support and architecture docs
- Improved accessibility and visual polish
- Documentation updated to v1.7 with comprehensive UI guidelines

### Risk Management

**Risk: Timeline Overrun**
- Mitigation: Focus on Phase 1-2 fixes first (Issues #1-7)
- These are the critical blocking issues
- Phase 3-4 can be deferred if necessary

**Risk: Complex Keyboard Navigation**
- Mitigation: Use Radix UI or Headless UI library instead of custom implementation
- These are fully accessible out of the box

**Risk: Screen Reader Testing Unavailable**
- Mitigation: Use browser extensions like NVDA for Windows
- VoiceOver is built into macOS
- Both are free

**Risk: New Issues Found During Testing**
- Mitigation: Budget 3-5 extra hours on Day 10
- Prioritize critical issues only
- Document minor issues for future work
