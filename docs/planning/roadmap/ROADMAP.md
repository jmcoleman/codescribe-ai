## 💰 Phase 2: Monetization Foundation (PLANNED)

**Timeline:** TBD (after Phase 1)
**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 weeks
**Status:** ✅ **PLANNING COMPLETE** - Implementation Files Ready
**Target Release:** v2.0.0
**Strategic Goal:** Enable sustainable business model with Open Core + Generous Free Tier architecture

### 📦 Epics

#### Epic 2.1: Authentication & User Management (3-5 days)
**Implementation:** Passport.js (decision documented in [AUTH-ANALYSIS.md](../AUTH-ANALYSIS.md))

- Email/password authentication with bcrypt hashing (`passport-local`)
- GitHub OAuth integration (`passport-github2`)
- JWT token-based sessions (`passport-jwt` for CLI/API in Phase 5)
- Password reset flow
- Auth routes: `/api/auth/signup`, `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/logout`, `/api/auth/github`
- Frontend auth context (React Context or Zustand)
- Login/Signup modal UI

**Rationale:** Passport.js selected over Clerk to support CLI authentication (Phase 5) and self-hosted enterprise deployment (Phase 6). See [AUTH-ANALYSIS.md](../AUTH-ANALYSIS.md) for full comparison.

#### Epic 2.2: Tier System & Feature Flags (2-3 days)
- Database setup (PostgreSQL or MongoDB)
- User schema (id, email, password_hash, tier, created_at)
- Usage schema (user_id, daily_count, monthly_count, reset_date)
- Tier gate middleware integration
- Usage tracking and quota enforcement
- Usage dashboard UI (show remaining quota)

#### Epic 2.3: Payment Integration (2-3 days)
- Stripe integration
- Subscription management (create, update, cancel)
- Webhook handling (tier updates on payment events)
- Pricing page UI
- Upgrade/downgrade flows

### Tier Structure (Feature Flags Ready)

**Free Tier (Generous - Drives Adoption):**
- ✅ All 4 documentation types (README, JSDoc, API, ARCHITECTURE)
- ✅ Real-time streaming, quality scoring, Monaco editor
- ✅ File upload, code parsing, Mermaid diagrams
- ⚠️ Limit: 10 docs/month OR unlimited self-hosted with own API key
- 💡 **Philosophy:** Portfolio-worthy for users, showcases full feature set

**Pro Tier ($9/mo - Volume + Convenience):**
- ✅ 100 docs/month (10x increase)
- ✅ Built-in API credits (no Claude API key setup)
- ✅ Batch processing (up to 10 files at once)
- ✅ Custom templates, priority queue
- ✅ Export formats (markdown, HTML, PDF)
- ✅ Version history (30 days)

**Team Tier ($29/mo - Collaboration):**
- ✅ 500 docs/month shared across 10 users
- ✅ Team workspace, shared templates
- ✅ Usage analytics dashboard
- ✅ Role-based access (admin, member, viewer)
- ✅ Slack + GitHub + CI/CD integrations
- ✅ Priority email support (24hr response)

**Enterprise Tier (Custom - Compliance + Control):**
- ✅ Unlimited docs, unlimited users
- ✅ SSO/SAML, audit logs, custom model fine-tuning
- ✅ Dedicated infrastructure, custom integrations
- ✅ White-label branding, on-premise deployment
- ✅ 99.9% SLA, dedicated Slack channel, account manager

### Strategic Rationale

**Why Open Core + Generous Free Tier?**
1. ✅ Free tier is portfolio-worthy (drives adoption)
2. ✅ Showcases full feature set (interview strength)
3. ✅ Feature flags demonstrate enterprise architecture
4. ✅ Volume limits create natural upgrade paths
5. ✅ Compounds over time (SEO, stars, testimonials)

**Conversion Psychology:**
- **Volume:** Hit 10-doc limit → Pro ($9 feels cheap for 100 docs)
- **Convenience:** Avoid API key setup → Pro (20 min vs. 30 sec)
- **Collaboration:** Team needs workspace → Team ($29 solves chaos)
- **Professional:** Company context → Enterprise (compliance ready)

**Proven Model (GitLab, Supabase, Ghost):**
- Generous free tier → 30M users → <1% paying → $150M ARR (GitLab)
- Year 1: Similar revenue to restricted free tier (~$10K MRR)
- Year 3: 2x revenue due to viral growth and SEO dominance

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Feature flag architecture integrated into existing codebase
- [ ] Users can sign up with email/password or GitHub OAuth
- [ ] Free tier tracked accurately (10 generations/month)
- [ ] Usage dashboard functional
- [ ] Stripe subscription flow working end-to-end
- [ ] All 660+ tests passing (including new auth/tier tests)
- [ ] Documentation updated (API docs, user guide, privacy policy)
- [ ] Deployed to production with monitoring

### Privacy & Security Notes
- **Database trade-off:** Moves from "privacy-first, no storage" to user accounts
  - Document this change in README and privacy policy
  - Emphasize: "We only store email, usage stats, and subscription info - never your code"
- **GDPR compliance:** Data export, account deletion
- **Security:** bcrypt password hashing, rate limiting on auth endpoints, HTTPS-only cookies, CSRF protection

## 🚨 Risks & Mitigation

### Deployment Risks

**Risk: Deployment Issues**
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Probability:** Low
- **Mitigation:** Test build locally first, Vercel has excellent docs, have Netlify as backup hosting

**Risk: Production Performance**
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Probability:** Low
- **Mitigation:** Already optimized (-85% bundle), lazy loading implemented, production build tested locally

**Risk: Environment Variable Issues**
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Probability:** Low
- **Mitigation:** Document all variables, test in Vercel preview environment before production

**Risk: Claude API Rate Limits**
- **Impact:** High
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Implement request queuing, show clear limits to users, monitor usage closely

### Future Risks (Phases 2-3)

## 🗺️ Updating the Interactive Roadmap

The project includes an interactive HTML roadmap ([ROADMAP-TIMELINE.html](ROADMAP-TIMELINE.html)) that visualizes the project timeline with embedded data. This section explains how to update it.

### Data Source

The roadmap data is stored in [roadmap-data.json](roadmap-data.json) and includes:
- Column structure (Done, Now, Next, Later)
- Phase details (versions, titles, features, durations)
- Metadata (title, links, footer text)
- Color scheme options (purple, indigo, slate, default)

### Update Workflow

**Prerequisites:** Have the HTML file open in a browser (locally via file:// or live-server)

1. **Edit the data source:**
   ```bash
   # Edit the JSON file with your changes
   vim docs/planning/roadmap/roadmap-data.json
   ```

2. **Load data into HTML:**
   - Open [ROADMAP-TIMELINE.html](ROADMAP-TIMELINE.html) in browser
   - Press **Shift+L** - Loads fresh data from roadmap-data.json
   - Verify changes appear correctly in the UI

3. **Save with embedded data:**
   - Press **Shift+S** - Downloads updated HTML with embedded data
   - File downloads to `~/Downloads/ROADMAP-TIMELINE.html`

4. **Copy back to project with automatic backup:**
   ```bash
   # Automated script (recommended)
   npm run roadmap:update

   # This script automatically:
   # 1. Backs up current HTML and JSON to private/roadmap-archives/
   # 2. Copies the latest downloaded HTML to project directory
   ```

   **Manual alternative (not recommended):**
   ```bash
   cp ~/Downloads/ROADMAP-TIMELINE.html docs/planning/roadmap/ROADMAP-TIMELINE.html
   # Note: This skips the automatic backup step
   ```

5. **Verify the update:**
   - **Hard refresh:** **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows/Linux)
   - Browser cache must be bypassed to load new embedded data
   - If using live-server, it may also need a restart

### Keyboard Shortcuts

When viewing [ROADMAP-TIMELINE.html](ROADMAP-TIMELINE.html) in browser:
- **T** - Toggle between full timeline view (4 columns) and planned-only view (3 columns)
- **Shift+L** - Load data from external roadmap-data.json file
- **Shift+S** - Save HTML with current embedded data (downloads file)

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: Changes don't appear after reloading HTML**
- **Cause:** Browser caching the old HTML file
- **Solution:** Hard refresh with **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows/Linux)
- **Alternative:** Clear browser cache or open in incognito/private window

**Issue: "Failed to fetch roadmap-data.json"**
- **Cause:** HTML file not in same directory as JSON file
- **Solution:** Either:
  - Open HTML from project directory (where JSON exists)
  - Use embedded data (don't press Shift+L, just rely on embedded data)

**Issue: Downloaded file named "ROADMAP-TIMELINE (2).html"**
- **Cause:** Browser auto-numbering duplicate downloads
- **Solution:** `npm run roadmap:update` always uses the most recent file

### Backup System

The update script automatically creates timestamped backups before making changes:

**Backup Location:** `private/roadmap-archives/`
- Directories are created automatically if they don't exist
- Safe to run on fresh clones or new machines

**Backup Format:**
- `ROADMAP-TIMELINE YYYYMMDD:HH:MM:SS.html` - Previous HTML state
- `roadmap-data YYYYMMDD:HH:MM:SS.json` - Previous JSON state

**Example:**
- `ROADMAP-TIMELINE 20251023:07:39:57.html`
- `roadmap-data 20251023:07:39:57.json`

**Benefits:**
- Safely revert to any previous version
- Track roadmap evolution over time
- Compare changes between versions
- No data loss if update goes wrong
- Zero manual setup required

### How It Works

1. **Embedded Data:** The HTML file contains a JavaScript object `ROADMAP_DATA` with all roadmap information
2. **Initial Render:** On page load, the HTML renders using its embedded data
3. **External Load:** Shift+L fetches roadmap-data.json and updates both the display and the embedded data in memory
4. **Save Operation:** Shift+S captures the entire HTML including the updated embedded data and downloads it
5. **Backup & Update:** Script backs up current files, then copies new HTML to project directory
6. **Standalone:** The HTML file works independently without the JSON file (uses embedded data)

### Files

- **[roadmap-data.json](roadmap-data.json)** - Source of truth for roadmap data
- **[ROADMAP-TIMELINE.html](ROADMAP-TIMELINE.html)** - Interactive visualization with embedded data
- **[../scripts/update-roadmap.sh](../../scripts/update-roadmap.sh)** - Automated update script with backup
- **`private/roadmap-archives/`** - Timestamped backups of HTML and JSON files

## 📌 Versioning Strategy

**Internal Planning (Phases):** Sequential phase numbers (Phase 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
- Used for project planning, roadmaps, and internal communication
- Phases can be flexible and evolve as needed

**Public Releases (SemVer):** Semantic versioning (v2.0.0, v3.0.0, v4.0.0, etc.)
- Used for GitHub releases, npm packages, changelogs, and user-facing documentation
- Allows for maintenance releases (v2.0.1, v2.1.1) between phases
- MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format:
  - **MAJOR** (v1 → v2): Breaking changes or major user-facing transformations (UX/UI overhaul, auth/database, CLI, extension)
  - **MINOR** (v2.0 → v2.1): New features within major version (dark mode, layout, new doc types)
  - **PATCH** (v2.0.0 → v2.0.1): Bug fixes, maintenance, no new features

**Mapping:**
- Phase 1 (MVP) → v1.0.0 (Initial production release)
- Phase 2 (Monetization Foundation) → v2.0.0 (MAJOR: Authentication, database, breaking architectural change)
- Phase 3 (UX Enhancements) → v3.0.0 (MAJOR: Complete UX transformation - theming, layout, file handling)
  - Epic 3.1 (Theming) could ship as v3.1.0 (MINOR)
  - Epic 3.2 (Layout) could ship as v3.2.0 (MINOR)
- Phase 4 (Documentation Capabilities) → v4.0.0 (MAJOR: New doc generation capabilities)
  - Epic 4.1 (OpenAPI) could ship as v4.1.0 (MINOR)
  - Epic 4.2 (Multi-file) could ship as v4.2.0 (MINOR)
- Phase 5 (Developer Tools) → v5.0.0 (MAJOR: CLI + VS Code extension, new product surfaces)
- Phase 6 (Enterprise Readiness) → v6.0.0 (MAJOR: Enterprise features, compliance, on-premise)

This hybrid approach allows flexible planning while maintaining industry-standard versioning for releases.
