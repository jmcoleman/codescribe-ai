## Overview

This document defines how CodeScribe AI organizes work into **Phases**, **Epics**, and **Tasks** to maintain strategic clarity and effective project planning.

---

## Three-Tier Hierarchy

### 1. **Phase = Strategic Theme** ("Why")
A phase represents a **cohesive strategic goal** or **user-facing value proposition** that typically spans 2-4 weeks of work.

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Strategic milestone with clear business value
- ✅ Can be communicated to stakeholders/users ("We're in Phase 3: UX Enhancements")
- ✅ Can be prioritized/reordered based on business needs
- ✅ Marketable as a product milestone
- ✅ Contains 2-4 related epics
- ❌ NOT a single feature (too granular)
- ❌ NOT longer than 4 weeks (too broad)

**Good Phase Examples:**
- **Phase 2: Payments Infrastructure** - Auth, tiers, payments
- **Phase 3: UX Enhancements** - Theming, layout, file handling
- **Phase 4: Documentation Capabilities** - New doc types, templates, exports
- **Phase 5: Developer Tools** - CLI, VS Code extension, API SDKs
- **Phase 6: Enterprise Readiness** - SSO, audit logs, on-premise

**Poor Phase Examples:**
- ❌ Phase 2: Dark Mode (too granular - this is a feature, not a strategic goal)
- ❌ Phase 3: Button Colors (way too tactical)
- ❌ Phase 2: Miscellaneous Improvements (no strategic cohesion)

---

### 2. **Epic = Deliverable Feature Set** ("What")
An epic groups related work that can be shipped as a cohesive unit, typically 2-5 days of work.

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Shippable increment of value
- ✅ Can be demoed to users
- ✅ Has clear acceptance criteria
- ✅ Contains 5-15 tasks
- ✅ Supports the parent phase's strategic goal

**Example Epic Structure in Documentation:**
```markdown
## 🎨 Phase 3: UX Enhancements (PLANNED)
**Strategic Goal:** Transform user experience with customization and flexibility

### 📦 Epics

#### Epic 3.1: Theming & Visual Customization (2 days)
- Dark mode toggle
- Theme persistence (localStorage)
- System preference detection
- Custom color schemes API

#### Epic 3.2: Layout & Workspace (3 days)
- Resizable panels with constraints
- Full-width layout option
- Layout presets (50/50, 70/30, etc.)
- Panel state persistence

#### Epic 3.3: Advanced File Handling (2 days)
- Multi-file upload
- Drag-and-drop UI
- File history/versions
```

**Heading Hierarchy:**
- `##` - Phase (strategic theme)
- `###` - Section within phase (Epics, Success Criteria, etc.)
- `####` - Individual epic or subsection

---

### 3. **Task = Implementation Detail** ("How")
A task is a specific piece of work that contributes to completing an epic, typically 1-4 hours.

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Actionable and specific
- ✅ Can be completed in a single work session
- ✅ Has clear done criteria

**Example Tasks (under Epic 3.1: Theming):**
- Add sun/moon toggle button to Header component
- Create ThemeContext with React Context API
- Implement CSS variable system with `data-theme` attribute
- Add theme toggle keyboard shortcut (Shift+T)
- Write Vitest tests for theme switching logic
- Update documentation with theming guide

---

## Key Principles

### **1. Phases = Strategic Milestones**
Every phase should answer: "What business value are we delivering?"

**Good:** Phase 3: UX Enhancements → "Making the app more customizable and user-friendly"
**Bad:** Phase 3: Dark Mode → "Adding one feature" (not strategic enough)

### **2. Cohesion Within Phases**
All epics in a phase should support the same strategic goal.

**Good (Cohesive):**
```
Phase 3: UX Enhancements
├── Theming (customization)
├── Layout flexibility (customization)
└── File handling (better workflow)
All support: "More customizable, flexible UX"
```

**Bad (Not Cohesive):**
```
Phase 3: Random Stuff
├── Dark mode (UX)
├── Payment processing (monetization)
└── CLI tool (developer tools)
These don't support a unified strategic goal
```

### **3. Right-Sizing Phases**
- **Too Small:** Phase 2: Add a button (1 day) - Just make it an epic in another phase
- **Just Right:** Phase 3: UX Enhancements (2-4 weeks) - Multiple related epics
- **Too Large:** Phase 2: Everything (6 months) - Break into multiple phases

### **4. Version Mapping**
Phases map to **MAJOR or MINOR** semantic versions:

- **Phase 1 (MVP)** → v1.0.0 (initial release)
- **Phase 2 (Payments)** → v2.0.0 (MAJOR: breaking architectural change)
- **Phase 3 (UX Enhancements)** → v3.0.0 (MAJOR: significant UX transformation)
  - Epic 3.1 (Theming) → v3.1.0 (MINOR: new feature)
  - Epic 3.2 (Layout) → v3.2.0 (MINOR: new feature)
- **Phase 4 (Doc Capabilities)** → v4.0.0 (MAJOR: new product capabilities)

---

## Benefits of This Approach

### **For Stakeholders**
✅ Clear strategic context: "We're in Phase 3: UX Enhancements"
✅ Business value is obvious: "This phase makes the app more customizable"
✅ Progress is trackable: "We've completed 2 of 3 epics in Phase 3"

### **For Planning**
✅ Phases can be prioritized/reordered based on business needs
✅ Dependencies between phases are clear
✅ Resource allocation is easier (dedicate 2-4 weeks to a phase)

### **For Marketing**
✅ Phases are sellable milestones: "Phase 3 brings massive UX improvements"
✅ Can announce phase completions: "CodeScribe AI v3.0: UX Enhancements"
✅ Roadmap communication is clearer: "Phase 4 coming Q2 2026"

### **For Development Team**
✅ Context for why we're building features: "This supports Phase 3's UX goals"
✅ Clear scope boundaries: "That's a Phase 5 feature, not Phase 3"
✅ Motivation from meaningful milestones: "We shipped Phase 3!"

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ **Feature-Driven Phases** (No Strategic Theme)
```
Phase 2: Dark Mode (1 day)
Phase 3: Buttons (2 days)
Phase 4: Tooltips (1 day)
```
**Problem:** No strategic cohesion, just a feature checklist.
**Fix:** Group into "Phase 2: UX Polish" with epics for theming, interactions, and feedback.

### ❌ **Kitchen Sink Phases** (No Cohesion)
```
Phase 2: Improvements
├── Dark mode (UX)
├── Payment processing (monetization)
├── CLI tool (developer tools)
└── Bug fixes (maintenance)
```
**Problem:** No unified strategic goal, impossible to communicate.
**Fix:** Split into separate phases (Payments, UX, Developer Tools).

### ❌ **Mega Phases** (Too Large)
```
Phase 2: Make Product Better (6 months, 50 features)
```
**Problem:** Too broad, no meaningful milestones, hard to track progress.
**Fix:** Break into 3-4 phases with 2-4 week durations.

### ❌ **Micro Phases** (Too Granular)
```
Phase 2: Add a single button (1 hour)
Phase 3: Change button color (30 minutes)
```
**Problem:** Too tactical, creates overhead of "phase management" for tiny tasks.
**Fix:** These are tasks within an epic, not phases.

## Decision Framework

**When planning new work, ask:**

1. **Is this a Phase?**
   - Does it represent a strategic milestone?
   - Will it take 2-4 weeks with multiple epics?
   - Can I communicate it to stakeholders as a cohesive goal?

2. **Is this an Epic?**
   - Is it a shippable feature set?
   - Will it take 2-5 days?
   - Does it support a phase's strategic goal?

3. **Is this a Task?**
   - Is it a specific implementation detail?
   - Can it be done in 1-4 hours?
   - Does it contribute to completing an epic?
