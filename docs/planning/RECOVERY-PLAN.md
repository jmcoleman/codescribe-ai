# File Recovery Plan

**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Status:** In Progress - Resume Tomorrow Morning

## üìã What Happened

During gh-pages branch work, the `private/` folder contents were lost:
- `private/VISION.md` - Strategic planning document
- `private/INTERVIEW-GUIDE.md` - Interview prep and demo scripts
- Possibly other files in `private/`

**Likely cause:** Branch switching or git operation that removed untracked files

---

## ‚úÖ What We've Recovered So Far

### 1. Design Archive Files (Fully Recovered)
- ‚úÖ `private/design-archive/GRAPHICS-FINAL-SUMMARY.md`
- ‚úÖ `private/design-archive/GRAPHICS-README.md`
- ‚úÖ `private/design-archive/favicon-comparison.html`

### 2. VISION.md Content (Partially Recovered from AUTH-ANALYSIS.md)

**Recovered sections:**

**Lines 32-36: Vision Statement**
```
Build a comprehensive AI-powered documentation toolkit that transforms how
developers create and maintain code documentation, starting with a web
application and expanding to CLI and VS Code integration.
```

**Lines 64-72: Competitive Differentiation**
- **vs. Mintlify:** Privacy-focused (no storage) vs. hosted solution / Code-first approach vs. documentation-site-first
- **vs. Swimm:** Lower barrier to entry
- **vs. GitHub Copilot:** Platform-agnostic (works with any codebase)

**Lines 239-248: Pricing Model**
- Enterprise tier: **$1,500/month** (includes SSO)

**Lines 254-276: Revenue Projections (Year 3)**
- 2,000 Pro users = $360,000/year
- 500 Team customers = $720,000/year
- 25 Enterprise customers @ $1,500/mo = $450,000/year
- **Total: $1,590,000/year**

**Source:** All content extracted from `docs/planning/AUTH-ANALYSIS.md` which had direct references with line numbers

## üìù Next Steps (Morning Session)

### 1. Reconstruct VISION.md
- [ ] Create new `private/VISION.md`
- [ ] Add recovered vision statement
- [ ] Add competitive landscape (lines 48-144)
- [ ] Add pricing model (lines 239-248)
- [ ] Add revenue projections (lines 254-276)
- [ ] Fill in gaps based on project knowledge

### 2. Recreate INTERVIEW-GUIDE.md
- [ ] Create template based on references found:
  - Interview talking points (from TODO.md reference)
  - Technical discussion guides (resource contention, etc.)
  - Demo scripts (from epics reference)
  - Portfolio presentation points

### 3. Check for Other Missing Files
- [ ] Review CLAUDE.md's private/ folder structure
- [ ] Identify any other missing files
- [ ] Prioritize what needs reconstruction

### 4. Prevent Future Loss
- [ ] Consider adding critical private/ content to encrypted git repo
- [ ] Set up Time Machine backups (currently not configured)
- [ ] Document recovery procedures

---

## üîç Additional Recovery Attempts (Optional)

### Recovery Software Already Tried
- ‚úÖ PhotoRec/TestDisk installed
- ‚ùå Scan recovered only system logs/cache (files may have been overwritten)

### Other Options to Try
- [ ] Check if VS Code has file history/cache
- [ ] Search for any backup files (*.bak, *~)
- [ ] Check iCloud Drive trash (if enabled)
- [ ] Use Disk Drill (GUI recovery tool) as alternative

## üí° Lessons Learned

1. **Critical files should be backed up** - Even gitignored files need backup strategy
2. **Branch switching is risky** - Untracked files can be lost
3. **Time Machine is essential** - Not currently configured for this machine
4. **Recovery is time-sensitive** - The sooner you try, the better the chances

---

## üìÇ File Locations

**Recovery directory:** `/Users/jcoleman-mbp/recovered_files/`
**Design archive (recovered):** `/Users/jcoleman-mbp/Developer/projects/codescribe-ai/private/design-archive/`

**Search script:** `~/find_recovered_files.sh`

## ‚òï Morning Checklist

1. ‚úÖ Get coffee
2. Review this document
3. Decide: Reconstruct or try more recovery methods?
4. Start with VISION.md reconstruction (most critical business data)
5. Create INTERVIEW-GUIDE.md template

---

**Remember:** The most important business data from VISION.md (pricing, revenue projections, competitive analysis) IS recoverable from AUTH-ANALYSIS.md. This is frustrating, but not catastrophic. üí™

**Get some rest!** Fresh eyes will make this much easier.
