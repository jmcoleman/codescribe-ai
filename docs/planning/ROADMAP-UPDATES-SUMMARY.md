# CodeScribe AI - Roadmap Updates Summary

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Update:** Phase 1.5 - WCAG AA Accessibility Compliance Added  
**Impact:** +5 days to project timeline (Days 6-10)

---

## What Changed

### NEW: Phase 1.5 - Accessibility Compliance (Days 6-10)

A comprehensive accessibility remediation phase has been added to the project roadmap between the original Phase 1 (web app development) and Phase 2 (CLI tool).

**Why:** The WCAG AA accessibility assessment identified 25 issues preventing full compliance. Without these fixes, the application is only ~60% WCAG AA compliant and may have legal/usability issues.

**Timeline:** 5-7 working days  
**Effort:** 38-53 hours  
**Result:** 100% WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance

- **Color blindness:** 8% of men, 0.5% of women

### Professional Quality
- **Portfolio project:** Demonstrates attention to detail
- **Best practices:** Shows understanding of modern web standards
- **Competitive advantage:** Many apps ignore accessibility

### SEO & Performance
- **Semantic HTML:** Better search engine rankings
- **Clear structure:** Easier for bots to crawl
