## üö® Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on Vercel
**Issue:** Build command fails or times out

**Solutions:**
1. Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Verify all dependencies in `package.json`
3. Test build locally: `npm run build`
4. Check Node.js version compatibility
5. Increase build timeout in Vercel settings

### Environment Variables Not Working
**Issue:** App can't access environment variables

**Solutions:**
1. Verify variables are set in Vercel dashboard
2. Check variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Redeploy after adding variables
4. For Vite, ensure variables start with `VITE_`
5. Check `.env.example` for reference

### API Calls Failing
**Issue:** Frontend can't reach backend API

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `VITE_API_URL` is correct production URL
2. Check CORS settings allow Vercel domain
3. Verify Claude API key is valid
4. Check API endpoint URLs are correct
5. Test API directly with cURL or Postman

### Slow Performance
**Issue:** App loads slowly in production

**Solutions:**
1. Verify lazy loading is working (check Network tab)
2. Check bundle size with `npm run build`
3. Ensure Vercel is serving from CDN
4. Run Lighthouse audit to identify issues
5. Check API response times

### Accessibility Issues in Production
**Issue:** Accessibility score drops in production

**Solutions:**
1. Run axe DevTools on production URL
2. Verify ARIA attributes are preserved in build
3. Test keyboard navigation
4. Check color contrast in production theme
5. Test with screen reader
