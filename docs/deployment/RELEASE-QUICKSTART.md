# Release Quickstart Guide

Quick reference for creating and deploying new releases of CodeScribe AI.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- [ ] All changes committed and pushed to a feature branch
- [ ] All tests passing locally
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with release notes
- [ ] Version numbers updated in package.json files (root, client, server)
- [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable)

## 🚀 Release Process

### Step 1: Update Version Numbers

Update version in all three package.json files:

```bash
# Root package.json
"version": "2.0.0"

# client/package.json
"version": "2.0.0"

# server/package.json
"version": "2.0.0"
```

### Step 2: Update CHANGELOG.md

Move items from `[Unreleased]` to a new release section:

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

---

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-26

**Status:** ✅ Feature Release - Phase 2: Payments Infrastructure

### Added
- Feature 1
- Feature 2
...
```

### Step 3: Push to Main Branch

```bash
# Commit version bump and changelog
git add package.json client/package.json server/package.json CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 2.0.0 - Phase 2 release"

# Push to main
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Automated CI/CD Pipeline

Once you push to `main`, GitHub Actions automatically runs:

#### 4.1 Test Phase (Parallel Execution)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   GitHub Actions Test Workflow (.github/   │
│          workflows/test.yml)                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ▼
        ┌───────────────────────┐
        │   All Tests Must Pass │
        └───────────────────────┘
                    ▼
    ┌───────┬───────┬───────┬────────┐
    ▼       ▼       ▼       ▼        ▼
┌────────┐ ┌────-┐ ┌────┐ ┌─────────┐
│Backend │ │Front│ │Lint│ │Security │
│ Tests  │ │ end │ │    │ │ Audit   │
│        │ │Tests│ │    │ │         │
└────────┘ └─────┘ └────┘ └─────────┘
```

**Jobs:**
1. **test-backend** - Backend unit & integration tests, coverage thresholds
2. **test-frontend** - Component tests (Vitest + React Testing Library)
3. **lint** - Code formatting check (Prettier)
4. **security** - Dependency vulnerability scan (npm audit)

#### 4.2 Deploy Phase (Conditional)

**Triggers only if:**
- ✅ All 4 test jobs pass
- ✅ Push is to `main` branch

```
        All Tests Passed? ──┐
                            │
                            ▼
                    ┌───────────────┐
                    │  Deploy Job   │
                    │ (Vercel Hook) │
                    └───────────────┘
                            ▼
                    ┌───────────────┐
                    │ Vercel Build  │
                    └───────────────┘
```

**Deploy Job Steps:**
```bash
# GitHub Actions triggers Vercel Deploy Hook
curl -X POST "${{ secrets.VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK }}"
```

### Step 5: Vercel Automatic Deployment

Vercel runs the build command from `vercel.json`:

```bash
cd server && \
  npm install && \
  npm run migrate && \        # ← Database migrations run here!
  cd ../client && \
  npm install && \
  npm run build
```

**Build Process:**
1. ✅ Install server dependencies
2. ✅ **Run database migrations** (`npm run migrate` executes migrations in `server/src/db/migrations/`)
3. ✅ Install client dependencies
4. ✅ Build optimized production bundle
5. ✅ Deploy to https://codescribeai.com

**⏱️ Expected Duration:** 2-3 minutes

### Step 6: Verify Deployment

Once deployment completes (you'll see ✅ in GitHub Actions):

1. **Check GitHub Actions:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/jmcoleman/codescribe-ai/actions
   - Verify "Tests" workflow shows ✅ green checkmark
   - Verify "Deploy to Vercel" job completed

2. **Verify Production:**
   - Visit: https://codescribeai.com
   - Test critical user flows:
     - [ ] Generate documentation (README)
     - [ ] File upload
     - [ ] Authentication (login/signup)
     - [ ] Password reset flow (if applicable)
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Test database operations (signup, login)

3. **Check Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/your-project/deployments
   - Verify deployment status is "Ready"
   - Check build logs for migration success

### Step 7: Create Git Tag

After verifying deployment is successful:

```bash
# Create annotated tag
git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Release v2.0.0 - Phase 2: Payments Infrastructure"

# Push tag to GitHub
git push origin v2.0.0
```

**Tag Naming Convention:**
- Use semantic versioning: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- Examples: `v1.0.0`, `v2.0.0`, `v2.1.0`, `v2.0.1`

### Step 8: Create GitHub Release

1. **Navigate to Releases:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/jmcoleman/codescribe-ai/releases/new

2. **Fill in Release Form:**
   - **Choose a tag:** Select `v2.0.0` from dropdown
   - **Release title:** `v2.0.0 - Phase 2: Payments Infrastructure`
   - **Description:** Copy release notes from CHANGELOG.md (see template below)
   - **Options:**
     - ✅ Check "Set as the latest release"
     - ⬜ Leave "Set as a pre-release" unchecked

3. **Release Notes Template:**

```markdown
## Release v2.0.0 - Phase 2: Payments Infrastructure

**Release Date:** October 26, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Production Release
**Phase:** Phase 2 (Payments Infrastructure)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Tests Fail in CI

**Problem:** GitHub Actions test workflow shows ❌ red X

**Solutions:**
1. Check which job failed (backend, frontend, lint, security)
2. Review logs in GitHub Actions
3. Run tests locally: `npm test` (in server/ or client/)
4. Fix failing tests
5. Push fixes to main

**Note:** Deploy job will NOT run if tests fail.

### Deployment Fails

**Problem:** Vercel deployment shows error or times out

**Common Issues:**
1. **Build timeout:** Increase `maxDuration` in vercel.json
2. **Migration failure:** Check Vercel logs for SQL errors
3. **Environment variables:** Verify all required vars are set in Vercel dashboard
4. **Database connection:** Check Neon database status

**Solutions:**
- View logs: Vercel Dashboard → Deployments → [Failed Deployment] → Build Logs
- Manual migration: Run `npm run migrate` locally with production DB credentials
- Redeploy: Push empty commit to trigger rebuild

### Migrations Don't Run

**Problem:** Database schema not updated after deployment

**Check:**
1. Verify `npm run migrate` in `vercel.json` buildCommand
2. Check Vercel build logs for migration output
3. Verify migrations exist in `server/src/db/migrations/`
4. Check `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable in Vercel

**Manual Fix:**
```bash
# Run migrations manually in production
# (Requires production database credentials)
cd server
POSTGRES_URL="your-production-db-url" npm run migrate
```

### Tag Already Exists

**Problem:** `git tag v2.0.0` fails with "tag already exists"

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Delete local tag
git tag -d v2.0.0

# Delete remote tag (if pushed)
git push --delete origin v2.0.0

# Recreate tag
git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Release v2.0.0"
git push origin v2.0.0
```

  - [ ] Authentication (login/signup)
  - [ ] Password reset flow (if applicable)
  - [ ] Payment flows (if applicable - test mode or live)
- [ ] Check browser console for errors (should be clean)
- [ ] Verify database migrations applied (check migration status)

### Finalization
