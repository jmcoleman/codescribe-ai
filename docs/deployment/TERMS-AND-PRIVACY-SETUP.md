## FAQ

**Q: Do I need a lawyer to review these?**
**A:** No. Termly templates are legally sufficient for standard SaaS. Only hire lawyer if you have complex IP, investors, or handle sensitive data (health, financial).

**Q: What if I miss something in the policies?**
**A:** Termly auto-updates templates when laws change. Review quarterly and update when you add new features (e.g., CLI, API access).

**Q: Can users sue me even with T&Cs?**
**A:** T&Cs reduce risk but don't eliminate it. That's why you need LLC + insurance. Arbitration clause in T&Cs makes disputes cheaper.

**Q: What's my refund policy?**
**A:** Suggested: "Full refund within 7 days of subscription start. Pro-rated refund for annual plans canceled within 30 days. No refunds for monthly plans after first month."

**Q: Do I need cookie consent banner?**
**A:** Not immediately. You only use essential cookies (auth) and anonymous analytics. Add banner when you use marketing cookies (Google Ads, Facebook Pixel).

**Q: What about GDPR right to deletion?**
**A:** Add "Delete Account" button in settings + handle email requests to support@codescribeai.com. Must delete within 30 days.
