# Deployment Learnings - CodeScribe AI

**Project:** CodeScribe AI - Production Deployment
**Deployment Platform:** Vercel
**Deployment Dates:** October 17-19, 2025
**Status:**  Successfully Deployed
**Production URL:** [https://codescribe-ai.vercel.app](https://codescribe-ai.vercel.app)

---

## =ï¿½ Executive Summary

This document captures critical learnings from deploying CodeScribe AI to Vercel production. The deployment process required 2 days of configuration, optimization, and troubleshooting, but resulted in a fully functional production application with CI/CD, security hardening, and performance optimization.

**Key Achievements:**
-  Production deployment with zero downtime
-  CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions
-  Environment variable security and sanitization
-  Build optimization for Vercel's platform
-  API URL centralization and configuration management
-  Monorepo detection and automatic builds

---

## =ï¿½ Key Learnings

### 1. Vercel Build Dependencies

**Critical Lesson:** In Vercel's build environment, `devDependencies` are NOT installed. Any package needed during `npm run build` must be in `dependencies`.

**What Happened:**
- Initial build failed with "Cannot find module 'vite'"
- Vite was in `devDependencies` but needed during build
- Vercel's build environment only installs `dependencies`, not `devDependencies`

**Solution:** Moved all build-time dependencies from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`:

```json
// client/package.json - Required in dependencies for Vercel
{
  "dependencies": {
    "vite": "^6.2.3",
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.4.1",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.4.17",
    "autoprefixer": "^10.4.20",
    "postcss": "^8.4.49",
    "rollup-plugin-visualizer": "^5.12.0"
  }
}
```

**Git Commits:**
- `1e51777` - fix vite during deploy by moving from a devdependency to a dependency
- `aed5312` - move more vite related devDependencies to dependencies
- `ea1f0d9` - move all build-time dependencies to dependencies for Vercel

**Recommendation:** For Vercel deployments, any package needed during the build step must be in `dependencies`. This differs from local development where `devDependencies` are installed.

---

### 2. API URL Centralization

**Critical Lesson:** Never hardcode API URLs in components. Use centralized configuration with environment variables.

**What Happened:**
- Frontend had hardcoded `http://localhost:3000` URLs throughout components
- Production deployment couldn't reach backend API
- Environment-specific URLs were scattered across multiple files

**Solution:** Created centralized configuration file:

```javascript
// client/src/config.js (NEW FILE)
const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3000';

export { API_BASE_URL };
```

**Updated All API Calls:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (scattered throughout components)
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/generate', { ... });

// AFTER (centralized)
import { API_BASE_URL } from './config';
const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/generate`, { ... });
```

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Development (client/.env.local)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Production (Vercel Environment Variables)
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-api.vercel.app
```

**Git Commit:** `7caf8dd` - use centralized api url logic

**Recommendation:** Create a single configuration file for all external URLs. Update all components to import from this file. Configure environment variables for different deployment environments.

---

### 3. Monorepo Auto-Detection

**Critical Lesson:** Vercel has excellent monorepo support built-in. Trust the auto-detection and avoid custom build commands unless absolutely necessary.

**What Happened:**
- Initial vercel.json had custom `buildCommand` and `installCommand`
- Custom commands interfered with Vercel's automatic monorepo detection
- Build failed to find correct output directory
- Vercel couldn't detect npm workspaces structure

**Solution:** Removed custom commands and let Vercel auto-detect:

```json
// vercel.json - BEFORE (caused issues)
{
  "buildCommand": "cd client && npm run build",
  "installCommand": "npm install && cd client && npm install"
}

// vercel.json - AFTER (works perfectly)
{
  // Let Vercel auto-detect monorepo structure
  // No custom commands needed!
}
```

**Root package.json Configuration:**
```json
{
  "name": "codescribe-ai",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "client",
    "server"
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npm run build --workspace=client"
  }
}
```

**Git Commit:** `b0dbbbe` - remove the custom build/install commands and let Vercel auto-detect the monorepo structure

**Recommendation:** For npm workspaces monorepos, configure `package.json` properly and let Vercel handle the rest. Only add custom commands if you have specific requirements.

---

### 4. Environment Variable Security

**Critical Lesson:** NEVER log sensitive environment variables. Use sanitization to prevent accidental API key exposure.

**What Happened:**
- Risk of accidentally exposing API keys in server logs
- Debugging code might log full environment object
- Vercel function logs are visible in dashboard

**Solution:** Implemented environment variable sanitization:

```javascript
// server/src/server.js
const sanitizedEnv = {
  NODE_ENV: process.env.NODE_ENV,
  PORT: process.env.PORT,
  HAS_CLAUDE_KEY: !!process.env.CLAUDE_API_KEY,  // Boolean instead of actual key
  ALLOWED_ORIGINS: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS,
  // NEVER expose the actual API key or other secrets
};

console.log('Server starting with environment:', sanitizedEnv);

// L NEVER DO THIS:
// console.log('Environment:', process.env);
```

**Created .env.example Files:**
```bash
# server/.env.example
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173

# client/.env.example
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Git Commits:**
- `18414f1` - sanitizing security
- `4d1ca1a` - Update deployment checklist for Vercel git integration setup

**Recommendation:**
1. Create `.env.example` files without actual secrets
2. Sanitize all log output to use boolean flags instead of actual keys
3. Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
4. Use Vercel's encrypted environment variables for production

---

### 5. CI/CD with GitHub Actions

**Critical Lesson:** Automate deployment from day one to prevent manual errors and ensure consistent deployments.

**What Happened:**
- Manual deployments via Vercel CLI were error-prone
- Needed consistent deployment process for team collaboration
- Wanted automatic deployments on push to main branch

**Solution:** Implemented GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to Vercel

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install Vercel CLI
        run: npm install --global vercel@latest

      - name: Pull Vercel Environment Information
        run: vercel pull --yes --environment=production --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build Project Artifacts
        run: vercel build --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}

      - name: Deploy Project Artifacts to Vercel
        run: vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```

**Required GitHub Secrets:**
1. `VERCEL_TOKEN` - Vercel authentication token (from Vercel account settings)
2. `VERCEL_ORG_ID` - Vercel organization ID (from `.vercel/project.json`)
3. `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` - Vercel project ID (from `.vercel/project.json`)

**Git Commit:** `2a7bc50` - add github actions deploy wf and fix vercel build command

**Recommendation:** Set up CI/CD early in the project. GitHub Actions + Vercel CLI provides reliable, automated deployments with full control over the build process.

## =ï¿½ Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. API Key Protection
-  Store API keys in environment variables only
-  Never commit `.env` files to version control
-  Sanitize logs to prevent accidental key exposure
-  Use Vercel's encrypted environment variables in production

### 2. CORS Configuration
```javascript
const allowedOrigins = process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS
  ? process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS.split(',')
  : ['http://localhost:5173'];

app.use(cors({
  origin: function (origin, callback) {
    if (!origin || allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
      callback(null, true);
    } else {
      callback(new Error('Not allowed by CORS'));
    }
  },
  credentials: true
}));
```

### 3. Rate Limiting
```javascript
const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: process.env.RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS || 60000,
  max: process.env.RATE_LIMIT_MAX || 10,
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.'
});

app.use('/api/', limiter);
```

## <ï¿½ Performance Optimization for Production

### Build Optimizations Applied

**Lazy Loading Strategy:**
- Monaco Editor: Loaded on first code interaction (4.85 KB gzipped)
- Mermaid.js: Loaded only when diagrams detected (139.30 KB gzipped)
- DocPanel: Lazy loaded with ReactMarkdown (281.53 KB gzipped)
- Modals: Individual lazy loading (2-12 KB each)

**Results:**
- Initial bundle: 78 KB gzipped (down from 516 KB, -85%)
- Total chunks: ~450 KB (loaded on demand)
- Lighthouse Performance: 75/100 (up from 45, +67%)
- Core Web Vitals:
  - FCP: 0.6s (down from 5.4s, -89%)
  - LCP: 1.0s (down from 13.9s, -93%)
  - TBT: 2,100ms (down from 3,000ms, -30%)

## = Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "Cannot find module 'vite'" during build

**Error:**
```
Error: Cannot find module 'vite'
    at Function.Module._resolveFilename
```

**Root Cause:** Vite is in `devDependencies` but Vercel doesn't install devDependencies during build.

**Solution:** Move vite to `dependencies`:
```bash
npm install --save vite
npm uninstall --save-dev vite
```

---

### Issue 2: Frontend can't reach backend API in production

**Error:**
```
Failed to fetch: http://localhost:3000/api/generate
TypeError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource
```

**Root Cause:** Frontend using hardcoded localhost URL instead of production API URL.

**Solution:** Centralize API URLs:
```javascript
// config.js
const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3000';
export { API_BASE_URL };
```

---

### Issue 3: Vercel build doesn't detect monorepo

**Error:**
```
Error: No build output found
Build failed with exit code 1
```

**Root Cause:** Custom build commands override Vercel's auto-detection.

**Solution:** Remove custom commands from vercel.json and let Vercel auto-detect npm workspaces.

---

### Issue 4: Transient Vercel Build Failures

**Error:**
```
Error: An unexpected error happened when running this build.
We have been notified of the problem. This may be a transient error.
If the problem persists, please contact Vercel Support
```

**Root Cause:** Transient infrastructure failures in Vercel's build system. This is NOT a code issue.

**Common Causes:**
1. **Build server failure** - The specific build server crashed or encountered an internal error
2. **Network issues** - Connection problems between Vercel and npm registry/GitHub
3. **Resource contention** - Build server overloaded or running out of resources
4. **Cache inconsistency** - Vercel's caching layer in inconsistent state
5. **Internal service timeout** - Vercel's internal services (artifact storage, etc.) temporarily failed

**Solution:** Simply retry the deployment:
```bash
# Re-trigger the deployment
vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod --token=$VERCEL_TOKEN

# Or via GitHub Actions - push a new commit or re-run workflow
```

**Why Retry Works:**
- You get assigned to a different (healthy) build server
- Network issues have resolved
- Cache layers have synchronized
- Internal services have recovered

**When to Worry:**
- â **One-time failure:** Normal and expected (~0.1% of deployments)
- â ï¸ **Repeated failures:** If >5% of deployments fail, check:
  1. Vercel status page: https://www.vercel-status.com/
  2. Build logs for specific errors (not generic "unexpected error")
  3. Contact Vercel support if persistent pattern

**Best Practice:** Consider adding automatic retry logic to CI/CD:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
- name: Deploy with Retry
  uses: nick-invision/retry@v2
  with:
    timeout_minutes: 10
    max_attempts: 3
    retry_wait_seconds: 30
    command: vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```

**Important Notes:**
- This is a cloud infrastructure issue, not your code
- All major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, Vercel) have occasional transient failures
- Industry standard uptime is ~99.9% (0.1% = occasional expected failures)
- CI/CD systems are designed to handle retry automatically

**Real Example:** October 20, 2025 - Deployment failed with "unexpected error," succeeded immediately on retry with zero code changes. Build logs showed Vercel platform issue, not application issue.

## Issue 5: Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights Not Loading

**Error:**
```
window.__VERCEL_ANALYTICS__ â undefined
window.__VERCEL_SPEED_INSIGHTS__ â undefined
```

**Root Causes:**
1. `import.meta.env.MODE === 'production'` returns false in Vercel builds
2. Nested `client/client/` directory created by running npm install from wrong directory
3. Packages not properly included in production build

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Use hostname-based production detection:**
```javascript
// client/src/main.jsx
const isProduction =
  window.location.hostname === 'codescribeai.com' ||
  window.location.hostname.includes('vercel.app')

{isProduction && (
  <>
    <Analytics />
    <SpeedInsights />
  </>
)}
```

**Step 2: Clean up nested directories:**
```bash
rm -rf client/client/
git add -A
git commit -m "Remove nested client directory"
```

**Step 3: Enable Speed Insights in Vercel Dashboard:**
- Settings â Speed Insights â Toggle ON
- Deploy changes
- Wait 15-30 minutes for data to appear

**Step 4: Verify in production:**

**IMPORTANT:** `window.__VERCEL_ANALYTICS__` and `window.__VERCEL_SPEED_INSIGHTS__` will show `undefined` even when working correctly. The packages don't expose global variables in newer versions.

**Correct Way to Verify (Network Tab):**
1. Open DevTools â Network tab
2. Check "Preserve log" checkbox
3. Filter by typing `vitals` or `insights`
4. Use the app for 30-60 seconds
5. Look for POST requests to:
   - `/_vercel/insights/view` (Analytics - page views)
   - `/_vercel/speed-insights/vitals` (Speed Insights - Web Vitals)
6. Both should show **Status: 200 OK** or **204 No Content**

**If you see 200/204 responses:** â Components are working correctly!

**Expected Timeline:**
- **Analytics (page views):** 5-10 minutes
- **Speed Insights (Web Vitals):** **24-48 hours** â ï¸ MUCH LONGER!

**Why Speed Insights Takes Longer:**
- Analytics shows every page view immediately (raw data)
- Speed Insights aggregates performance metrics from multiple sessions
- Needs statistically significant data to calculate percentiles (P75)
- Dashboard waits for minimum threshold of complete user sessions
- First data typically appears after 1-2 days of traffic

**Git Commits:**
- `a78ec14` - add vercel speed-insights package for analytics
- `6749267` - Fix analytics not loading - use hostname detection instead of env.MODE
- `d3485b6` - Remove typeof window check from analytics detection
- `320ad90` - resolving analytics deploy issues (removed nested client/client/)

## Issue 6: Speed Insights Shows "No data available" Despite Working Components

**Dashboard Message:**
```
"No data available. Make sure you are using the latest @vercel/speed-insights package."
```

**Symptoms:**
- Analytics dashboard showing visitors and page views â
- Speed Insights dashboard showing "Get Started" setup page with "No data points collected"
- Network tab shows successful POST requests to `/_vercel/speed-insights/vitals` (200 OK)
- `window.__VERCEL_SPEED_INSIGHTS__` returns `undefined` (this is normal!)

**Root Cause:**
Speed Insights has a **24-48 hour delay** before first data appears in dashboard. This is by design, not a bug.

**Why the Delay:**
1. **Data Aggregation:** Speed Insights doesn't show individual measurements like Analytics
2. **Statistical Significance:** Waits for enough sessions to calculate meaningful percentiles (P75)
3. **Multiple Metrics:** Each measurement includes 5+ Web Vitals (FCP, LCP, CLS, TBT, INP)
4. **Quality Threshold:** Won't display until it has high-confidence performance data

**How to Verify It's Working (While Waiting for Dashboard):**

**Method 1: Network Tab (Most Reliable)**
1. Open production site with DevTools â Network tab
2. Enable "Preserve log" checkbox
3. Filter by `vitals` or `insights`
4. Use the app normally for 1-2 minutes
5. Look for POST request to `/_vercel/speed-insights/vitals`
6. **Status 200 or 204 = Working! â**

**Method 2: Check Multiple Times**
- Visit site from different browsers/devices
- Complete full user sessions (don't just refresh)
- Each visit sends new vitals data
- More sessions = faster dashboard population

**Expected Timeline:**
- **Day 1:** Components installed, data being sent (Network tab shows 200 OK)
- **Day 2:** Enough data collected, dashboard starts showing metrics
- **Day 3+:** Full historical data and trends available

**Solution:**
â **If Network tab shows 200/204 responses:** Everything is working! Just wait 24-48 hours.
â **If Network tab shows no requests:** Components not loading - check hostname detection logic.

**Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] Network tab shows POST to `/_vercel/speed-insights/vitals` with 200 OK
- [ ] Analytics dashboard shows page views (proves components load)
- [ ] Speed Insights enabled in Vercel Dashboard (Settings â Speed Insights)
- [ ] Using latest package version (`@vercel/speed-insights@1.2.0`)
- [ ] Multiple user sessions completed (at least 10+)
- [ ] Waited at least 24 hours since first deployment

**Common Misconception:**
â "Dashboard says 'no data' so components aren't working"
â "Network tab shows 200 OK so components ARE working, dashboard just needs time"

**Real Example:**
- October 20, 2025: Components deployed, Network tab confirmed 200 OK responses
- Dashboard showed "No data points collected" 
- After 24-48 hours: Dashboard populated with Real Experience Score and Web Vitals graphs

**Pro Tip:** Don't debug further if Network tab shows 200 OK responses. Just wait!

## Issue 7: GitHub Actions Deployment - "Project not found" Error

**Error:**
```
Error: Project not found ({"VERCEL_PROJECT_ID":"***","VERCEL_ORG_ID":"***"})
> [debug] #2 â 404 Not Found
```

**Symptoms:**
- Local `vercel deploy` works fine
- GitHub Actions deployment fails with 404
- Environment variables show as set (YES) in workflow logs
- `.vercel/project.json` created but Vercel CLI can't find project
- All deployments showing as "Canceled" in Vercel dashboard

**Root Causes:**
1. **Wrong Project ID format** - Used Project ID from Vercel Settings page but had typo (`it2` instead of `lt2`)
2. **Wrong Org ID format** - Used `team_xxx` format from old Vercel Settings, but CLI expects team slug
3. **Outdated Vercel CLI** - Older CLI versions had bugs with project detection

**Critical Discovery:**
The Project ID and Org ID values shown in Vercel's web dashboard **may not match** what the CLI expects! Always use `vercel` CLI commands to get the correct values.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Update Vercel CLI to latest version:**
```bash
npm install -g vercel@latest
```

**Step 2: Get correct Project ID using CLI:**
```bash
vercel project inspect codescribe-ai
```

**Output:**
```
Found Project jenni-colemans-projects/codescribe-ai

  General
    ID                          prj_h7LVP6tjkw52lt2Eoh99hxwXHJUR  â Use this exact value
    Name                        codescribe-ai
    Owner                       Jenni Coleman's projects
```

â ï¸ **CRITICAL:** Copy the ID character-by-character! Common mistakes:
- `it2` vs `lt2` (lowercase i vs lowercase L)
- Extra spaces before/after
- Missing characters when copy-pasting

**Step 3: Get correct Org ID (team slug) using CLI:**
```bash
vercel teams list
```

**Output:**
```
id                          Team name
jenni-colemans-projects     Jenni Coleman's projects  â Use the ID column (slug), NOT team_xxx format
```

**Step 4: Update GitHub Secrets with CLI-provided values:**

Go to: `https://github.com/[username]/codescribe-ai/settings/secrets/actions`

| Secret Name | Correct Value | Wrong Value (Don't Use) |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` | `prj_h7LVP6tjkw52lt2Eoh99hxwXHJUR` | `prj_h7LVP6tjkw52it2Eoh99hxwXHJUR` (typo: it2) |
| `VERCEL_ORG_ID` | `jenni-colemans-projects` | `team_fzBS6hN894eToZoYOLi50Ath` (wrong format) |
| `VERCEL_TOKEN` | [from Vercel Dashboard â Settings â Tokens] | [any expired token] |

**Step 5: Simplify GitHub Actions workflow:**

Instead of complex `vercel pull` â `vercel build` â `vercel deploy --prebuilt` workflow, use single command:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
- name: Deploy to Vercel
  run: vercel deploy --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }} --debug
  env:
    VERCEL_ORG_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
    VERCEL_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
```

This lets Vercel handle project detection, build, and deployment in one step.

**Why This Works:**
- `vercel deploy --prod` uses environment variables for authentication
- Reads `vercel.json` for build configuration
- No need to manually create `.vercel/project.json` or run `vercel pull`
- Single command = fewer failure points

**Verification:**
After updating secrets and pushing changes, check GitHub Actions logs for:
```
â Deployment started
â Building project
â Deployment complete
Production: https://codescribe-ai.vercel.app
```

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**

â **Don't use values from:**
- Vercel web dashboard Settings page (may be outdated)
- `.vercel/project.json` from another machine (machine-specific)
- Old documentation or screenshots

â **Always get fresh values from:**
- `vercel project inspect [project-name]` (for Project ID)
- `vercel teams list` (for Org ID/team slug)
- Vercel Dashboard â Settings â Tokens (for fresh token)

**Debugging Tips:**

If deployment still fails with 404:
1. **Verify CLI version:** `vercel --version` (should be 48.4.1+)
2. **Test locally first:** `vercel deploy --prod` from project root
3. **Check token scope:** Token must have access to the team/project
4. **Verify secrets exist:** GitHub Settings â Secrets should show 3 secrets
5. **Check secret names:** Must be EXACTLY `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, `VERCEL_TOKEN` (case-sensitive)

**Timeline:**
- **Hours spent debugging:** ~2 hours
- **Root cause:** Typo in Project ID (`it2` vs `lt2`) + wrong Org ID format
- **Fix time:** 5 minutes once correct values identified

**Key Lesson:**
When GitHub Actions deployment fails but local deployment works, the issue is almost always **incorrect or stale credentials/IDs in GitHub Secrets**, NOT your code or workflow configuration.

**Git Commits:**
- `671bf43` - Fix environment variable expansion in .vercel/project.json
- `ba6e499` - Simplify deployment: use vercel deploy directly
- `74e2212` - Trigger deployment with corrected Vercel credentials

## Issue 8: Vercel Git Integration - "Ignored Build Step" Blocking Deployments

**Error:**
No error message! Deployments simply don't trigger automatically when pushing to GitHub.

**Symptoms:**
- Code pushed to GitHub main branch
- No automatic deployment triggered in Vercel
- Last successful deployment was hours/days ago
- Vercel Git Integration shows as "Connected" with GitHub repo
- Manual "Redeploy" button works, but automatic deployments don't

**Root Cause:**
**"Ignored Build Step" setting was set to "Don't build anything"** instead of "Automatic".

This setting silently prevents Vercel from building on every push, even though the Git integration appears to be properly connected.

**Critical Discovery:**
You can have Vercel Git Integration fully connected and configured, but if "Ignored Build Step" is misconfigured, **zero deployments will happen automatically**. No error messages, no warnings in logs - just silence.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Check the Ignored Build Step setting:**
```
Vercel Dashboard â Project â Settings â Git â Ignored Build Step
```

**Should be set to:** `Automatic` (default)
**Not:** `Don't build anything` â

**Step 2: Fix the setting:**
1. Change from "Don't build anything" to **"Automatic"**
2. Click **Save**
3. You'll see a warning: "Configuration Settings in the current Production deployment differ from your current Project Settings"
   - This is expected - the old deployment used the old settings

**Step 3: Trigger a fresh deployment:**

**Option A: Redeploy from Vercel Dashboard**
- Go to Deployments tab
- Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment
- New deployment will use "Automatic" setting

**Option B: Push a new commit**
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger automatic deployment"
git push
```
- Vercel will automatically detect and deploy

**Step 4: Verify automatic deployments work:**
- Make a small change to your code
- Push to main branch
- Check Vercel Deployments tab - should automatically start building within seconds

**Why This Happens:**

The "Ignored Build Step" setting allows you to conditionally skip builds based on file changes or custom logic. Common use cases:
- Only build when certain files change (e.g., skip builds for README updates)
- Use a custom script to determine if build is needed

**Setting options:**
- **Automatic (default):** Build on every push
- **Don't build anything:** Never build automatically (useful for manual-only deployments)
- **Custom command:** Use a script that exits with code 0 (build) or 1 (skip)

**When might "Don't build anything" get set:**
- Testing manual deployments
- Temporarily disabling auto-deploy
- Migrating from another deployment method
- Accidentally changed during settings exploration

**How to Avoid This Issue:**

â **Use Vercel Git Integration as primary deployment method** (not GitHub Actions)
â **Keep "Ignored Build Step" on "Automatic"** unless you have specific needs
â **Check Vercel project settings first** when deployments mysteriously stop
â **Test automatic deployment** after any settings changes

**Debugging Checklist:**

If automatic deployments stop working:
1. âï¸ Check Vercel Dashboard â Settings â Git â Is repo connected?
2. âï¸ Check "Ignored Build Step" setting â Should be "Automatic"
3. âï¸ Check "Production Branch" â Should match your main branch name
4. âï¸ Check GitHub â Settings â Webhooks â Vercel webhook should exist and be active
5. âï¸ Try manual "Redeploy" â If this works, it's a Git integration config issue

**Competing Deployment Methods:**

â ï¸ **Don't run multiple deployment methods simultaneously:**
- Vercel Git Integration (automatic on push)
- GitHub Actions with Vercel CLI (also triggers on push)
- Manual deployments via `vercel` CLI

**Running multiple methods causes:**
- Deployment conflicts and cancellations
- Wasted build minutes
- Confusing deployment logs
- Race conditions

**Best Practice:** Pick ONE method:
- **Vercel Git Integration:** Easiest, most reliable (recommended for most projects)
- **GitHub Actions:** More control, custom workflows, can run tests first
- **Manual CLI:** Development/testing only

**Timeline:**
- **Hours spent debugging:** ~3 hours (combined with GitHub Actions troubleshooting)
- **Root cause:** "Ignored Build Step" set to "Don't build anything"
- **Fix time:** 2 minutes once setting was discovered

**Key Lesson:**
**Always check the Vercel project settings in the dashboard first**, before debugging GitHub Actions workflows, CLI commands, or tokens. The simplest explanation is often the correct one.

**Related Issues:**
- See Issue #7 for GitHub Actions "Project not found" errors
- Both issues stemmed from trying to use GitHub Actions when Vercel Git Integration was the better/simpler solution

**Git Commits:**
- `b952a4b` - Disable GitHub Actions deployment workflow (switched to Vercel Git Integration)
- Settings change in Vercel Dashboard (not tracked in git)

## Issue 9: Test-Gated Deployment with Deploy Hooks

**Challenge:**
Need to ensure tests pass BEFORE deploying to production, while using reliable Vercel Git Integration (avoiding GitHub Actions deployment complexity).

**Initial Problem:**
- Vercel Git Integration deploys immediately on every push (parallel with tests)
- Risk of deploying broken code if tests fail
- GitHub Actions deployment had credential/configuration issues (see Issue #7)

**Solution: Hybrid Approach with Deploy Hooks**

Use Vercel Deploy Hooks triggered by GitHub Actions ONLY after tests pass, while disabling automatic Git deployments.

**Architecture:**
```
Push to main
    â
GitHub Actions: Run Tests (2-3 min)
    ââ Backend Tests
    ââ Frontend Tests
    ââ Lint
    ââ Security Audit
    â
All tests PASS â
    â
Deploy Job: curl POST to Vercel Deploy Hook
    â
Vercel: Build & Deploy to Production
```

**Implementation:**

**Step 1: Create Vercel Deploy Hook**

1. Vercel Dashboard â Project â Settings â Git â Deploy Hooks
2. Click "Create Hook"
3. Name: "Deploy after tests pass"
4. Branch: `main`
5. Copy the hook URL (starts with `https://api.vercel.com/v1/integrations/deploy/...`)

**Step 2: Add Deploy Hook to GitHub Secrets**

1. GitHub â Repository â Settings â Secrets and variables â Actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Name: `VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK`
4. Value: Paste the hook URL from Step 1
5. Save

**Step 3: Disable Automatic Git Deployments**

Add to `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "git": {
    "deploymentEnabled": {
      "main": false
    }
  }
}
```

This prevents Vercel from automatically deploying on Git pushes while still allowing Deploy Hook deployments.

**Step 4: Keep Ignored Build Step as "Automatic"**

In Vercel Dashboard â Settings â Git â Ignored Build Step:
- Set to: **"Automatic"**
- This allows Deploy Hook deployments to proceed

**Critical:** Do NOT set to "Don't build anything" - this blocks Deploy Hook deployments too!

**Step 5: Add Deploy Job to Test Workflow**

Add to `.github/workflows/test.yml`:
```yaml
deploy:
  name: Deploy to Vercel
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  # Only deploy if all tests passed
  needs: [test-backend, test-frontend, lint, security]
  # Deploy on push to main OR manual trigger
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'

  steps:
    - name: Trigger Vercel Deploy Hook
      run: |
        echo "ð All tests passed! Triggering Vercel deployment..."
        curl -X POST "${{ secrets.VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK }}"
        echo "â Deployment triggered successfully"
```

**How It Works:**

1. **Git push to main** â Tests run, no automatic Vercel deployment
2. **Tests fail** â Deploy job never runs, no deployment â
3. **Tests pass** â Deploy job calls webhook â Vercel deploys â
4. **Manual trigger** â Tests run â Deploy job runs (if on main branch)

**Verification:**

After pushing code, check:
1. GitHub Actions shows all test jobs passing
2. Deploy job runs and calls webhook (check logs for JSON response)
3. Vercel Dashboard shows ONE deployment (triggered by "Deploy Hook")
4. No duplicate deployments from Git Integration

**Benefits:**

â **Tests must pass** before any production deployment
â **No duplicate deployments** (Git Integration disabled for main)
â **Reliable Vercel deployment** (no GitHub Actions Project ID issues)
â **Simple webhook integration** (just a curl command)
â **Works with manual triggers** (workflow_dispatch events)

**Troubleshooting:**

**Issue: Deploy Hook returns PENDING but never builds**
- Check: Ignored Build Step should be "Automatic" (NOT "Don't build anything")
- The git.deploymentEnabled setting only blocks Git pushes, not Deploy Hooks

**Issue: Two deployments on every push**
- Check: vercel.json has `"deploymentEnabled": { "main": false }`
- Check: Git Integration still connected (needed for Deploy Hook to work)

**Issue: Deploy job skipped on manual trigger**
- Check: Deploy job condition allows both push and workflow_dispatch
- Use: `if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'` (no event_name check)

**Issue: Tests run but deploy job never runs**
- Check: All test jobs (backend, frontend, lint, security) must pass
- Check: Push was to main branch (not develop or feature branch)

**Comparison to Other Approaches:**

| Approach | Tests Gate Deployment | Reliability | Complexity |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|------------|
| **Vercel Git Integration Only** | â No (parallel) | â High | â Low |
| **GitHub Actions Deployment** | â Yes | â ï¸ Medium (Project ID issues) | â ï¸ High |
| **Deploy Hooks (This)** | â Yes | â High | â Medium |

**Key Configuration Files:**

`vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "git": {
    "deploymentEnabled": {
      "main": false
    }
  }
}
```

`.github/workflows/test.yml`:
```yaml
deploy:
  needs: [test-backend, test-frontend, lint, security]
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  steps:
    - run: curl -X POST "${{ secrets.VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK }}"
```

**Timeline:**
- **Hours spent researching:** ~2 hours (testing different approaches)
- **Root cause:** Needed to combine Vercel Deploy Hooks with git.deploymentEnabled
- **Implementation time:** 30 minutes once approach was clear

**Key Lesson:**
Vercel Deploy Hooks + `git.deploymentEnabled` configuration provides the best of both worlds: test-gated deployment with Vercel's reliable infrastructure. This hybrid approach is superior to pure GitHub Actions deployment for most use cases.

**Related Issues:**
- See Issue #7 for why GitHub Actions deployment alone is problematic
- See Issue #8 for Vercel Git Integration automatic deployment setup

**Git Commits:**
- Added deploy job to test.yml workflow
- Added `git.deploymentEnabled` to vercel.json
- Created VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK GitHub secret

## Issue 10: Missed Release Tagging - Creating Retroactive Git Tags and Releases

**Problem:**
After deploying v1.2.1 to production, the git tag and GitHub release were forgotten. By the time it was noticed, v1.2.2 had already been released and tagged.

**Symptoms:**
- Production deployment happened without corresponding git tag
- GitHub releases page missing v1.2.1 release
- CHANGELOG.md has v1.2.1 entry but no matching tag in git history
- Tag history shows v1.2.0 â v1.2.2 (v1.2.1 missing)

**Why This Matters:**
- **Version history gaps** confuse contributors and users
- **Release notes missing** from GitHub releases page
- **Breaking semantic versioning** (appears to skip from v1.2.0 to v1.2.2)
- **CI/CD issues** if pipelines depend on tags
- **Portfolio credibility** - incomplete release history looks unprofessional

**Root Cause:**
Release tagging was not part of the documented deployment checklist, making it easy to forget during the deployment rush.

**Solution: Create Retroactive Tags and Releases**

**Step 1: Identify the Correct Commit**

First, find which commit represents the v1.2.1 release:

```bash
# View recent commit history
git log --oneline --all -20

# View commit graph to understand branching
git log --oneline --graph --all -10

# View full details of a specific commit
git show COMMIT_HASH --stat
```

**Key indicators of the right commit:**
- Date matches CHANGELOG.md date for the release
- Comes chronologically AFTER previous release (v1.2.0)
- Comes chronologically BEFORE next release (v1.2.2)
- Contains the changes documented in CHANGELOG.md for that version

**Example from CodeScribe AI:**
```bash
$ git log --oneline --graph --all -10
* 31d93e6 roadmap updated for v1.2.2
* b83d818 v1.2.2 maintenance release: mobile compatibility and UX polish
* 4495715 added an interactive roadmap
* 3efe329 readme and vercel deployment doc updates
* 0ef49dc updated changelog for recent improvements  â This is v1.2.1
```

**Step 2: Verify Commit in GitHub**

Before tagging, confirm the commit exists in GitHub:

**Method A: Direct URL**
```
https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO/commit/COMMIT_HASH
```

**Example:**
```
https://github.com/jmcoleman/codescribe-ai/commit/0ef49dc
```

**Method B: GitHub Web UI**
1. Go to repository on GitHub
2. Click "Commits" link (below green Code button)
3. Use search box (top right) and paste commit hash
4. Verify commit message and date

**Method C: Git Show**
```bash
# Get full commit details including author and date
git show 0ef49dc --stat

# Output shows:
# commit 0ef49dcaab2c208e9cc23ce59012faa33323f1c8
# Author: Jenni Coleman <jenni.m.coleman@gmail.com>
# Date:   Tue Oct 21 21:25:52 2025 -0400
#     updated changelog for recent improvements
```

**Step 3: Create Retroactive Git Tag**

Create an annotated tag pointing to the specific commit (NOT current HEAD):

```bash
# Syntax: git tag -a VERSION COMMIT_HASH -m "MESSAGE"
git tag -a v1.2.1 0ef49dc -m "v1.2.1 - Bug fixes: footer alignment, download button UX, sign-in button hiding"

# Verify tag was created
git tag -l "v1.2.*"
# Output:
# v1.2.0
# v1.2.1
# v1.2.2

# Verify tag points to correct commit
git show v1.2.1 --stat
```

**Critical Notes:**
- â **Use `-a` flag** to create annotated tag (includes metadata)
- â **Include commit hash** to tag a specific commit (not HEAD)
- â **Use meaningful message** that summarizes the release
- â **Don't tag HEAD** if you've made commits since the release

**Step 4: Push Tag to GitHub**

```bash
# Push the single tag
git push origin v1.2.1

# Verify on GitHub
# Go to: https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO/tags
# Should see v1.2.1 in the list
```

**Step 5: Create GitHub Release**

**Option A: Using GitHub CLI (Recommended)**

```bash
# Install gh CLI if not already installed
# brew install gh (macOS)
# See: https://cli.github.com/

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Create release with notes from CHANGELOG
gh release create v1.2.1 \
  --title "v1.2.1 - Bug Fixes" \
  --notes "$(cat <<'EOF'
**Status:** â Bug Fixes (Included in v1.2.2 release)

### Fixed
- **DocPanel Footer Alignment**
  - Fixed DocPanel footer to match CodePanel footer alignment
  - Ensured consistent padding across both panels

- **Download Button UX**
  - Removed checkmark animation from download button
  - Simplified to static Download icon with toast notification

- **Sign In Button**
  - Hidden non-functional Sign In button until authentication is implemented
  - Added feature flag system: ENABLE_AUTH = false

- **Examples Modal**
  - Fixed preview persistence and focus alignment issues
  - Enhanced focus styles for mobile

### Testing
- Visual regression testing across Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Mobile testing (iOS, Android) for responsive behavior
- Verified 660+ tests passing with 100% pass rate
EOF
)"
```

**Option B: Using GitHub Web UI**

1. Go to: `https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO/releases/new`
2. Click "Choose a tag" dropdown â Select `v1.2.1` (will appear after Step 4)
3. Release title: `v1.2.1 - Bug Fixes`
4. Description: Copy relevant section from CHANGELOG.md (lines 86-131)
5. **Target:** Verify shows correct commit hash (0ef49dc)
6. Click "Publish release"

**Step 6: Verify Retroactive Release**

**Check Git Tags:**
```bash
git tag -l "v1.2.*"
# Should show: v1.2.0, v1.2.1, v1.2.2

git log --oneline --decorate --all | grep -E "v1\.2\.[0-2]"
# Should show tags on correct commits
```

**Check GitHub:**
1. **Releases page:** `github.com/USERNAME/REPO/releases`
   - v1.2.2, v1.2.1, v1.2.0 should all be listed
   - Dates should be in correct chronological order
2. **Tags page:** `github.com/USERNAME/REPO/tags`
   - All three tags should appear
3. **Individual release:** `github.com/USERNAME/REPO/releases/tag/v1.2.1`
   - Should show correct commit hash
   - Should show "This release was created retroactively" if you add that note

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

â **Tagging HEAD when you've moved forward:**
```bash
# WRONG - tags current commit, not the v1.2.1 commit
git tag -a v1.2.1 -m "v1.2.1"
```

â **Creating lightweight tag instead of annotated:**
```bash
# WRONG - no metadata, harder to manage
git tag v1.2.1 0ef49dc
```

â **Using wrong commit hash:**
```bash
# WRONG - verify hash carefully (0ef49dc vs 0ef49cd)
git tag -a v1.2.1 0ef49cd -m "v1.2.1"
```

â **Not verifying commit in GitHub first:**
```bash
# WRONG - tag might point to local commit not pushed yet
git tag -a v1.2.1 LOCAL_COMMIT_HASH -m "v1.2.1"
```

â **Using Project ID from GitHub instead of commit hash:**
```bash
# WRONG - confusing Project ID with commit hash
git tag -a v1.2.1 prj_xxx -m "v1.2.1"
```

**Prevention: Add to Deployment Checklist**

To prevent future missed tags, add to deployment process:

**In [DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md](./DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md):**

```markdown
### Create GitHub Release
- [ ] Create git tag for the release
- [ ] Push tag to GitHub
- [ ] Create GitHub Release with changelog notes

**Standard Release Process:**
1. Create annotated tag: `git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "v1.2.0 - Production Release"`
2. Push tag: `git push origin v1.2.0`
3. Create release: `gh release create v1.2.0 --title "..." --notes "..."`
```

**Timeline:**
- **Issue discovered:** October 22, 2025 (after v1.2.2 release)
- **Time to identify correct commit:** ~10 minutes
- **Time to create tag and release:** ~5 minutes
- **Total fix time:** ~15 minutes

**Key Lessons:**

1. **Release tagging should be automated** or prominently featured in deployment checklist
2. **Git commit history is the source of truth** - use `git log` to find commits, not memory
3. **Verify in GitHub first** - ensure commit exists remotely before creating tag
4. **Character-by-character accuracy matters** - typos in commit hashes silently fail
5. **Retroactive tagging is safe** - doesn't affect existing code or deployments
6. **Document the process** - future maintainers will thank you

- See DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md for standard release tagging process
- See Issue #7 for GitHub Actions credential management
- See Issue #9 for test-gated deployment workflow

**Git Commits:**
- Tag created locally: `git tag -a v1.2.1 0ef49dc -m "..."`
- Tag pushed to GitHub: `git push origin v1.2.1`
- Release created via GitHub web UI
- DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md updated with release tagging section
