---

## =ï¿½ Executive Summary

This document captures critical learnings from deploying CodeScribe AI to Vercel production. The deployment process required 2 days of configuration, optimization, and troubleshooting, but resulted in a fully functional production application with CI/CD, security hardening, and performance optimization.

**Key Achievements:**
-  Production deployment with zero downtime
-  CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions
-  Environment variable security and sanitization
-  Build optimization for Vercel's platform
-  API URL centralization and configuration management
-  Monorepo detection and automatic builds

---

## =ï¿½ Key Learnings

### 1. Vercel Build Dependencies

**Critical Lesson:** In Vercel's build environment, `devDependencies` are NOT installed. Any package needed during `npm run build` must be in `dependencies`.

**What Happened:**
- Initial build failed with "Cannot find module 'vite'"
- Vite was in `devDependencies` but needed during build
- Vercel's build environment only installs `dependencies`, not `devDependencies`

**Solution:** Moved all build-time dependencies from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`:

```json
// client/package.json - Required in dependencies for Vercel
{
  "dependencies": {
    "vite": "^6.2.3",
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.4.1",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.4.17",
    "autoprefixer": "^10.4.20",
    "postcss": "^8.4.49",
    "rollup-plugin-visualizer": "^5.12.0"
  }
}
```

**Git Commits:**
- `1e51777` - fix vite during deploy by moving from a devdependency to a dependency
- `aed5312` - move more vite related devDependencies to dependencies
- `ea1f0d9` - move all build-time dependencies to dependencies for Vercel

**Recommendation:** For Vercel deployments, any package needed during the build step must be in `dependencies`. This differs from local development where `devDependencies` are installed.

---

### 2. API URL Centralization

**Critical Lesson:** Never hardcode API URLs in components. Use centralized configuration with environment variables.

**What Happened:**
- Frontend had hardcoded `http://localhost:3000` URLs throughout components
- Production deployment couldn't reach backend API
- Environment-specific URLs were scattered across multiple files

**Solution:** Created centralized configuration file:

```javascript
// client/src/config.js (NEW FILE)
const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3000';

export { API_BASE_URL };
```

**Updated All API Calls:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (scattered throughout components)
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/generate', { ... });

// AFTER (centralized)
import { API_BASE_URL } from './config';
const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/generate`, { ... });
```

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Development (client/.env.local)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Production (Vercel Environment Variables)
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-api.vercel.app
```

**Git Commit:** `7caf8dd` - use centralized api url logic

**Recommendation:** Create a single configuration file for all external URLs. Update all components to import from this file. Configure environment variables for different deployment environments.

---

### 3. Monorepo Auto-Detection

**Critical Lesson:** Vercel has excellent monorepo support built-in. Trust the auto-detection and avoid custom build commands unless absolutely necessary.

**What Happened:**
- Initial vercel.json had custom `buildCommand` and `installCommand`
- Custom commands interfered with Vercel's automatic monorepo detection
- Build failed to find correct output directory
- Vercel couldn't detect npm workspaces structure

**Solution:** Removed custom commands and let Vercel auto-detect:

```json
// vercel.json - BEFORE (caused issues)
{
  "buildCommand": "cd client && npm run build",
  "installCommand": "npm install && cd client && npm install"
}

// vercel.json - AFTER (works perfectly)
{
  // Let Vercel auto-detect monorepo structure
  // No custom commands needed!
}
```

**Root package.json Configuration:**
```json
{
  "name": "codescribe-ai",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "client",
    "server"
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npm run build --workspace=client"
  }
}
```

**Git Commit:** `b0dbbbe` - remove the custom build/install commands and let Vercel auto-detect the monorepo structure

**Recommendation:** For npm workspaces monorepos, configure `package.json` properly and let Vercel handle the rest. Only add custom commands if you have specific requirements.

---

### 4. Environment Variable Security

**Critical Lesson:** NEVER log sensitive environment variables. Use sanitization to prevent accidental API key exposure.

**What Happened:**
- Risk of accidentally exposing API keys in server logs
- Debugging code might log full environment object
- Vercel function logs are visible in dashboard

**Solution:** Implemented environment variable sanitization:

```javascript
// server/src/server.js
const sanitizedEnv = {
  NODE_ENV: process.env.NODE_ENV,
  PORT: process.env.PORT,
  HAS_CLAUDE_KEY: !!process.env.CLAUDE_API_KEY,  // Boolean instead of actual key
  ALLOWED_ORIGINS: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS,
  // NEVER expose the actual API key or other secrets
};

console.log('Server starting with environment:', sanitizedEnv);

// L NEVER DO THIS:
// console.log('Environment:', process.env);
```

**Created .env.example Files:**
```bash
# server/.env.example
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173

# client/.env.example
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Git Commits:**
- `18414f1` - sanitizing security
- `4d1ca1a` - Update deployment checklist for Vercel git integration setup

**Recommendation:**
1. Create `.env.example` files without actual secrets
2. Sanitize all log output to use boolean flags instead of actual keys
3. Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
4. Use Vercel's encrypted environment variables for production

---

### 5. CI/CD with GitHub Actions

**Critical Lesson:** Automate deployment from day one to prevent manual errors and ensure consistent deployments.

**What Happened:**
- Manual deployments via Vercel CLI were error-prone
- Needed consistent deployment process for team collaboration
- Wanted automatic deployments on push to main branch

**Solution:** Implemented GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to Vercel

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install Vercel CLI
        run: npm install --global vercel@latest

      - name: Pull Vercel Environment Information
        run: vercel pull --yes --environment=production --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build Project Artifacts
        run: vercel build --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}

      - name: Deploy Project Artifacts to Vercel
        run: vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```

**Required GitHub Secrets:**
1. `VERCEL_TOKEN` - Vercel authentication token (from Vercel account settings)
2. `VERCEL_ORG_ID` - Vercel organization ID (from `.vercel/project.json`)
3. `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` - Vercel project ID (from `.vercel/project.json`)

**Git Commit:** `2a7bc50` - add github actions deploy wf and fix vercel build command

**Recommendation:** Set up CI/CD early in the project. GitHub Actions + Vercel CLI provides reliable, automated deployments with full control over the build process.

## =ï¿½ Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. API Key Protection
-  Store API keys in environment variables only
-  Never commit `.env` files to version control
-  Sanitize logs to prevent accidental key exposure
-  Use Vercel's encrypted environment variables in production

### 2. CORS Configuration
```javascript
const allowedOrigins = process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS
  ? process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS.split(',')
  : ['http://localhost:5173'];

app.use(cors({
  origin: function (origin, callback) {
    if (!origin || allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
      callback(null, true);
    } else {
      callback(new Error('Not allowed by CORS'));
    }
  },
  credentials: true
}));
```

### 3. Rate Limiting
```javascript
const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: process.env.RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS || 60000,
  max: process.env.RATE_LIMIT_MAX || 10,
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.'
});

app.use('/api/', limiter);
```

## = Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "Cannot find module 'vite'" during build

**Error:**
```
Error: Cannot find module 'vite'
    at Function.Module._resolveFilename
```

**Root Cause:** Vite is in `devDependencies` but Vercel doesn't install devDependencies during build.

**Solution:** Move vite to `dependencies`:
```bash
npm install --save vite
npm uninstall --save-dev vite
```

---

### Issue 2: Frontend can't reach backend API in production

**Error:**
```
Failed to fetch: http://localhost:3000/api/generate
TypeError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource
```

**Root Cause:** Frontend using hardcoded localhost URL instead of production API URL.

**Solution:** Centralize API URLs:
```javascript
// config.js
const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3000';
export { API_BASE_URL };
```

---

### Issue 3: Vercel build doesn't detect monorepo

**Error:**
```
Error: No build output found
Build failed with exit code 1
```

**Root Cause:** Custom build commands override Vercel's auto-detection.

**Solution:** Remove custom commands from vercel.json and let Vercel auto-detect npm workspaces.

---

### Issue 4: Transient Vercel Build Failures

**Error:**
```
Error: An unexpected error happened when running this build.
We have been notified of the problem. This may be a transient error.
If the problem persists, please contact Vercel Support
```

**Root Cause:** Transient infrastructure failures in Vercel's build system. This is NOT a code issue.

**Common Causes:**
1. **Build server failure** - The specific build server crashed or encountered an internal error
2. **Network issues** - Connection problems between Vercel and npm registry/GitHub
3. **Resource contention** - Build server overloaded or running out of resources
4. **Cache inconsistency** - Vercel's caching layer in inconsistent state
5. **Internal service timeout** - Vercel's internal services (artifact storage, etc.) temporarily failed

**Solution:** Simply retry the deployment:
```bash
# Re-trigger the deployment
vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod --token=$VERCEL_TOKEN

# Or via GitHub Actions - push a new commit or re-run workflow
```

**Why Retry Works:**
- You get assigned to a different (healthy) build server
- Network issues have resolved
- Cache layers have synchronized
- Internal services have recovered

**When to Worry:**
- â **One-time failure:** Normal and expected (~0.1% of deployments)
- â ï¸ **Repeated failures:** If >5% of deployments fail, check:
  1. Vercel status page: https://www.vercel-status.com/
  2. Build logs for specific errors (not generic "unexpected error")
  3. Contact Vercel support if persistent pattern

**Best Practice:** Consider adding automatic retry logic to CI/CD:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
- name: Deploy with Retry
  uses: nick-invision/retry@v2
  with:
    timeout_minutes: 10
    max_attempts: 3
    retry_wait_seconds: 30
    command: vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```

**Important Notes:**
- This is a cloud infrastructure issue, not your code
- All major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, Vercel) have occasional transient failures
- Industry standard uptime is ~99.9% (0.1% = occasional expected failures)
- CI/CD systems are designed to handle retry automatically

**Real Example:** October 20, 2025 - Deployment failed with "unexpected error," succeeded immediately on retry with zero code changes. Build logs showed Vercel platform issue, not application issue.

## Issue 5: Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights Not Loading

**Error:**
```
window.__VERCEL_ANALYTICS__ â undefined
window.__VERCEL_SPEED_INSIGHTS__ â undefined
```

**Root Causes:**
1. `import.meta.env.MODE === 'production'` returns false in Vercel builds
2. Nested `client/client/` directory created by running npm install from wrong directory
3. Packages not properly included in production build

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Use hostname-based production detection:**
```javascript
// client/src/main.jsx
const isProduction =
  window.location.hostname === 'codescribeai.com' ||
  window.location.hostname.includes('vercel.app')

{isProduction && (
  <>
    <Analytics />
    <SpeedInsights />
  </>
)}
```

**Step 2: Clean up nested directories:**
```bash
rm -rf client/client/
git add -A
git commit -m "Remove nested client directory"
```

**Step 3: Enable Speed Insights in Vercel Dashboard:**
- Settings â Speed Insights â Toggle ON
- Deploy changes
- Wait 15-30 minutes for data to appear

**Step 4: Verify in production:**
```javascript
// Should return objects (not undefined)
window.__VERCEL_ANALYTICS__
window.__VERCEL_SPEED_INSIGHTS__
```

**Expected Timeline:**
- Analytics (page views): 5 minutes
- Speed Insights (Web Vitals): 15-30 minutes

**Git Commits:**
- `a78ec14` - add vercel speed-insights package for analytics
- `6749267` - Fix analytics not loading - use hostname detection instead of env.MODE
- `d3485b6` - Remove typeof window check from analytics detection
- `320ad90` - resolving analytics deploy issues (removed nested client/client/)
