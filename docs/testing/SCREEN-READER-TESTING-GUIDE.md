## üêõ Common Issues to Watch For

### Issue 1: Elements Not Announced
**Symptom:** VoiceOver skips over buttons or says "unlabeled"
**Check:** Look for missing `aria-label` or button text
**Status:** ‚úÖ Should not occur (all elements labeled)

### Issue 2: Dynamic Content Silent
**Symptom:** Error appears but VoiceOver doesn't announce it
**Check:** Verify `aria-live="assertive"` on ErrorBanner
**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented in ErrorBanner.jsx

### Issue 3: Focus Stuck in Modal
**Symptom:** Can't tab out of modal with keyboard
**Check:** Focus trap implementation
**Status:** ‚úÖ Focus traps implemented + Escape closes modal

### Issue 4: Decorative Icons Announced
**Symptom:** VoiceOver reads icon names (e.g., "X icon")
**Check:** Verify `aria-hidden="true"` on decorative icons
**Status:** ‚úÖ All decorative icons marked aria-hidden
